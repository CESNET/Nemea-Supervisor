Supervisor as a Munin plugin
----------------------------

Nemea Supervisor contains Munin plugin (nemea_supervisor) that is
able to retrieve statistical information from the Nemea system
(via Supervisor).

It is a python script that calls supervisor_cli and connects to
running supervisor daemon.
To modify the default behaviour of the Munin plugin, see variables
at the beginning of the nemea_supervisor script. It is possible to
change various variables (up to the "end of configuration" header).

The plugin is installed into ${datadir}/munin/plugins.

To enable the installed Munin plugins, create symbolic links e.g.:
  ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/nemea_supervisor /etc/munin/plugins/
  ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/nemea_ipfixcol2 /etc/munin/plugins/
and restart munin-node.
