Supervisor:
=================

Supervisor can run in one of two basic modes:
1) Interactive Mode:
  ./supervisor -f config_file.xml

2) Daemon Mode:
  Supervisor is executed with `--daemon` and runs as a process in backround
  of the operating system.
  ./supervisor -f config_file.xml --daemon

  The activity of the running daemon can be controlled by a special thin client:
  ./supervisor_cli (client for controlling the daemon)

  Both daemon and client supports `-s` to specify path to the UNIX socket
  that is used for communication between daemon and client.

  Note: paths must match to communicate with right Supervisor daemon

Statistics about Nemea modules:
==================
  Supervisor client has a special mode that is enabled by `-x`. It allows user
  to get statistics about message numbers and cpu usage of modules.
  In `-x` mode, client connects to the supervisor, receives and prints statistics,
  disconnects and terminates.
  ./supervisor_cli -x

  Note: Supervisor daemon must be running.

Output format - description:
------------------------
<module unique name>,<information type>,<statistics/identification>

For different "information type", the part "statistics/identification" differs.

Example#1:
  flowcounter1,in,0,1020229
The example means: number of received messages (1020229) of input interface (in)
with interface number (0) of the module (flowcounter1).

Example#2:
  traffic_repeater2,out,0,510114,392,2
The example means: number of sent messages (510114), number of sent buffers (392),
number of executed "buffer auto-flushes" (2) of output interface (out)
with interface number (0) of the module (traffic_repeater2).

Example#3:
  flowcounter1,cpu,2,1
The example means: usage of CPU (cpu) in percent in kernel mode (2) and user mode (1)
of the module (flowcounter1).
