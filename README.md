# Supervisor

This module allows user to configure and monitor Nemea modules (see [basic modules](https://github.com/CESNET/Nemea-Modules) and [detectors](https://github.com/CESNET/Nemea-Detectors)).
User specifies modules in xml configuration file, which is input for the Supervisor and it is shown and described in the section "Configuration file".


## How to build

Simply with:

```sh
./bootstrap.sh
./configure
make
```
Useful parameters for configure are `--prefix`, `--libdir` and `--bindir`.

And possible installation:

```sh
sudo make install
```


## Dependencies

Supervisor needs the following to be installed:

- libxml2 devel package
- [Nemea-framework](https://github.com/CESNET/Nemea-Framework).


## Program arguments

List of **mandatory** arguments the program accepts:
- `-T FILE` or `--config-template=path`   Path of the XML file with the configuration template.
- `-L PATH` or `--logs-path=path`   Path of the directory where the logs (both supervisor's and modules') will be saved.

List of **optional** arguments the program accepts:
- `-d` or `--daemon`   Runs supervisor as a system daemon.
- `-h` or `--help`   Prints this help.
- `-s SOCKET` or `--daemon-socket=path`   Path of the unix socket which is used for supervisor daemon and client communication.
- `-C PATH` or `--configs-path=path`   Path of the directory where the generated configuration files will be saved.



## Program modes

Supervisor can run in one of the following modes:

####1) Interactive Mode

```
supervisor -T supervisor_config_template.xml -L logs_path
```

####2) System daemon

Program is executed with `-d` (or `--daemon`) argument and runs as a process in backround.

```
supervisor -T supervisor_config_template.xml -L logs_path --daemon
```

  The activity of the running daemon can be controlled by a special thin client:

```
supervisor_cli (after installation from RPM, there is symlink "supcli" for the client)
```

  Both daemon and client supports optional `-s` to specify path to the UNIX socket
  that is used for communication between daemon and client (more information about the client can be found in the section "Supervisor client").

####3) System service

Supervisor is installed as a systemd service with the following commands:

- service nemea-supervisor start - starts the deamon
- service nemea-supervisor stop - stops the deamon and all running Nemea modules from its configuration
- service nemea-supervisor restart - performs service start and service stop
- service nemea-supervisor status - returns running or stopped
- service nemea-supervisor reload - updates the configuration according to the configuration file


## Configuration file

###Example

Example configuration file with comments: [config_example.xml](https://github.com/CESNET/Nemea-Supervisor/blob/master/configs/config_example.xml)


###Real usage of the configuration file

It is split into smaller parts called **sup files** (file.sup) for easier maintaining by multiple users. Example of a such file is [this sup file](https://github.com/CESNET/Nemea-Supervisor/blob/master/configs/detectors/dnstunnel_detection.sup) containing a configuration of one Nemea detection module called dns tunnel detector.

Sup files can be placed into directories according to their category (e.g. detectors, data-sources etc.). It is shown [here](https://github.com/CESNET/Nemea-Supervisor/tree/master/configs).

[XML template](https://github.com/CESNET/Nemea-Supervisor/blob/master/configs/supervisor_config_template.xml.in) helps to gather all the sup files and to construct the final configuration file using following directives:

```xml
<!-- include path_to_sup_file -->
<!-- include path_to_sup_files_dir -->
```

Path to the XML template is one of mandatory parameters for the supervisor (`-T FILE` or `--config-template=path`).


###Reload configuration

The most important functionality of the supervisor. It updates the configuration according to the configuration file. It has the following phases:

- **Generate** config - generates the final configuration file by replacing include directives in XML template with the content of the .sup files
- **Validate** config - checks the generated config file according to defined syntax and semantic rules (structure and values)
- **Apply** config - if the validation successfully finishes, all changes are applied to the running configuration


## Configuring modules

User can do various operations with modules via Supervisor. After launch appears
menu with available operations:

1. START ALL MODULES - starts all modules from loaded configuration
2. STOP ALL MODULES - stops all modules from loaded configuration
3. START MODULE - starts one specific module from loaded configuration
4. STOP MODULE - stops one specific module from loaded configuration
5. STARTED MODULES STATUS - displays status of loaded modules (stopped or running)
                            and PIDs of modules processes
6. AVAILABLE MODULES - prints out actual loaded configuration
7. RELOAD CONFIGURATION - operation allows user to reload actual configuration
                          from initial xml file or from another xml file
8. STOP SUPERVISOR - this operation terminates whole Supervisor


Note: for reload operation is important unique module name. There are three cases,
      that can occur during reloading:

a) Supervisor didnt find a module with same name in loaded configuration -> inserting a new
   module.
b) Supervisor found a module with same name in loaded configuration -> compares every value
   and if there is a difference, the module will be reloaded.
c) Module in loaded configuration was not found in reloaded configuration -> it is
   removed.



## Monitoring modules

Supervisor monitors the status of all modules which depends on "enabled flag" of the module. If the status is stopped and the flag is set to true, modules is restared. There is limit of restarts per minute which can be modified in configuration file (optional element module-restarts). On the other hand if the module is running and flag is set to false, SIGINT is used to stop the module. If it keeps running, SIGKILL is used to stop it.

Every Nemea module can be run with special "service" interface (see [configuration file](supervisor_config.xml)), which allows Supervisor to get statistics about module interfaces. These stats include following counters:

- input interface: received messages, recevied buffers
- output interface: sent messages, sent buffers, dropped messages, autoflushes

Data sent via service interface are encoded in JSON format. More information about stats utilization [here](#statistics-about-nemea-modules)

Last monitored event is CPU usage (kernel and user modes) and system memory usage of every module.



## Log files

Supervisor uses log files for its own output and also for an output of the started modules.

Path of the logs can be specified in two ways:
- in configuration file (optional element logs-directory in example configuration file)
- program parameter (-L path, --logs-path=path) can be used only in the begining

If the path is specified with the parameter and also in the configuration file, bigger priority has the config file.
The path can be changed during runtime by adding or changing the element in the config file and performing reload configuration.

In case the user-defined path is not correct (process has no permissions to create the directories etc.), default path is used.
The path depends on the current supervisors mode:
- interactive mode: `/tmp/interactive_supervisor_logs/`
- daemon mode: `/tmp/daemon_supervisor_logs/`
- netconf mode: `/tmp/netconf_supervisor_logs/`

These paths are used because /tmp directory is accesable by every process so the output wonÂ´t be lost.

Content of the log directory is as follows:
- logs-path/supervisor_log
- logs-path/supervisor_debug_log
- logs-path/supervisor_log_module_events - log with modules events (starting module [module_name], connecting to module [module_name], error while receiving from module [module_name] etc.)
- logs-path/supervisor_log_statistics
- logs-path/modules_logs/ - contains files with started modules stdout and stderr in form of [module_name]_stdout and [module_name]_stderr



## Program termination

Supervisor can be terminated via one of the menu options (interactive mode "STOP SUPERVISOR" or daemon mode "Dstop") or via sending a signal.



### Backup file

Supervisor is able to terminate without stopping running modules and "find" them again after restart. This is achived via backup file which is generated during termination if needed.
Every backup file is bound to unique configuration file so the path is chosen according to it. The path is `/tmp/PREFIX_sup_backup_file.xml` where "PREFIX" is a number computed from absolute path of the configuration file.
The backup file contains current configuration with PIDs of running modules.
Together with backup file is also generated info file with basic information about current configuration.

Example:

```
./supervisor -f /data/configs/supervisor_config.xml
```

Start some modules and terminate supervisor. Because of running modules it generates following files:

- `/tmp/65018_sup_backup_file.xml` - backup file
- `/tmp/65018_sup_backup_file.xml_info` - file with basic information about current configuration

If the user executes supervisor with the same configuration file (which is also saved in the .xml_info file), supervisor will automatically find the backup file, loads the configuration and connects to running modules.



### Signals

Signal handler catches following signals:

- SIGTERM - stops all running modules and does not generate backup file (the only case modules are stopped)
- SIGINT - it let the modules continue running and generates backup file
- SIGQUIT - same as SIGINT
- SIGSEGV - this is for case something goes wrong during runtime. SIGSEGV is catched, modules continue running and backup file is saved.



## Supervisor client

The client communicates with supervisor daemon (process in the background - supervisor started with `-d` argument) via UNIX socket which can be specified with `-s SOCKET` just like supervisor. According to the optional given argument it performs one of the following commands:

- reload supervisor - `./supervisor_cli -r`
- get modules statistics - `./supervisor_cli -x`
- enter configuration mode - `./supervisor_cli`

Note: All these parameters are optional so if the client is started without them (`./supervisor_cli`), it uses default socket path (/tmp/daemon_supervisor.sock) and enters configuration mode.



### Statistics about Nemea modules

  Supervisor client has a special mode that is enabled by `-x`. It allows user
  to get statistics about message numbers and cpu usage of modules.
  In `-x` mode, client connects to the supervisor, receives and prints statistics,
  disconnects and terminates.
```
./supervisor_cli -x
```

  Note: Supervisor daemon must be running.

### Output format

```
<module unique name>,<information type>,<statistics/identification>
```

For different "information type", the part "statistics/identification" differs.

Example#1:
```
flowcounter1,in,0,1020229
```
The example means: number of received messages (1020229) of input interface (in)
with interface number (0) of the module (flowcounter1).

Example#2:
```
traffic_repeater2,out,0,510114,392,2
```
The example means: number of sent messages (510114), number of sent buffers (392),
number of executed "buffer auto-flushes" (2) of output interface (out)
with interface number (0) of the module (traffic_repeater2).

Example#3:
  flowcounter1,cpu,2,1
The example means: usage of CPU (cpu) in percent in kernel mode (2) and user mode (1)
of the module (flowcounter1).
